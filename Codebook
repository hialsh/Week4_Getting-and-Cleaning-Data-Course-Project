X: bind of x_train and x_test
Y: bind of y_train and y_test
Subject: bind of subject_test and subject_train
AllMerged: bind of X, Y and Subject

3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
ExtData: Mean and std extracted only from the 2nd column of Features

4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
ActivityNames: Giving a name on each code of Activities

5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Columns: Giving a column name on ExtData. Each column's name is updated by using gsub.
